#  Optimizing Sales Strategies Through Exponential Data Analysis using pandas 📊💼




 I conducted a comprehensive business analysis of sales data using  Python Pandas & Python Matplotlib to analyze and answer business questions about 12 months worth of sales data. The data contains hundreds of thousands of electronics store purchases broken down by month, product type, cost, purchase address, etc. 

I started by merging 12 months sales data into a single CSV file, performing data cleaning, and augmenting the dataset with additional columns, I laid the foundation for in-depth analysis and actionable insights.  Tasks during this section include:
- Drop NaN values from DataFrame
- Removing rows based on a condition
- Change the type of columns (to_numeric, to_datetime, astype)

After i cleaned up the data a bit, i moved to the data exploration section. In this section i explore 5 high level business questions related to the data:
- What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
- What city sold the most product?
- What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customer’s buying product?
- What products are most often sold together?
- What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?
